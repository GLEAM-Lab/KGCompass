Based on the issue, we need to implement an `append()` method for the `JsonPointer` class that maintains immutability by concatenating string representations and recompiling. However, I don't see the `JsonPointer` class in the provided code segments. The issue mentions it should be similar to existing append methods in utility classes like `TextBuffer` and `ByteArrayBuilder`, but we need the actual `JsonPointer` class to implement this properly.

Since the `JsonPointer` class is not shown in the provided code segments, I cannot generate a proper *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit for it. The implementation would need to:

1. Take another JsonPointer as input
2. Concatenate their string representations 
3. Create a new JsonPointer instance from the combined string
4. Return the new instance

The implementation would look something like this (but we need the actual class file to provide exact line numbers and context):

```java
public JsonPointer append(JsonPointer tail) {
    String current = toString();
    String toAppend = tail.toString();
    return compile(current + toAppend);
}
```

Could you please provide the content of the `JsonPointer` class file so I can generate the proper edit with correct line numbers and context? The implementation needs to be added to that specific class.

From the discussion, we know:
- It should maintain immutability
- It should concatenate string representations
- It should use the existing `compile` method
- It should return a new instance

But without seeing the actual `JsonPointer.java` file, I cannot provide the exact edit location and surrounding context needed for a proper *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit.
