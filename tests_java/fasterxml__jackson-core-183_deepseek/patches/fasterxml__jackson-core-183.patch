Based on the issue, the bug is in `TextBuffer.java` where `getTextBuffer()` returns inconsistent values (`null` vs empty array `[]`) for an empty string. According to the issue comment, returning an empty array is the expected behavior.

The issue occurs because:
1. After `resetWithEmpty()`, `getTextBuffer()` returns null since no buffer is allocated yet
2. After `contentsAsString()`, an empty array is created and cached in `_resultArray`
3. Subsequent `getTextBuffer()` calls return the cached empty array

To fix this, we should modify `resetWithEmpty()` to initialize an empty array immediately, making behavior consistent from the start.

Here's the edit:

```java
### playground/fasterxml__jackson-core/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/util/TextBuffer.java
- start_line : 154
- end_line : 154
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    public void resetWithEmpty()
=======
    public void resetWithEmpty() {
        _inputStart = -1;
        _currentSize = 0;
        _inputLen = 0;
        _inputBuffer = null;
        _resultString = null;
        _resultArray = new char[0]; // Initialize empty array
        _currentSegment = null;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that:
1. `getTextBuffer()` will always return an empty array for an empty text buffer
2. The behavior is consistent before and after `contentsAsString()`
3. Matches the expected behavior mentioned in the issue comment

The fix maintains all existing functionality while making the empty buffer case consistent. All other methods that interact with the buffer will continue to work as before, but now with a properly initialized empty array state.
