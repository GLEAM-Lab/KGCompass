Based on the issue, the bug is in the `Version.compareTo` method in `com/fasterxml/jackson/core/Version.java` where it doesn't compare `_snapshotInfo` (pre-release identifiers) according to semver rules. The current implementation only compares major, minor, and patch versions.

Here's the proposed fix that will compare snapshotInfo alphabetically as suggested in the comments:

```java
### com/fasterxml/jackson/core/Version.java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Version other)
    {
        if (other == this) return 0;
        
        int diff = _major - other._major;
        if (diff == 0) {
            diff = _minor - other._minor;
            if (diff == 0) {
                diff = _patchLevel - other._patchLevel;
            }
        }
        return diff;
    }

        if (other == this) return 0;
        
        int diff = _major - other._major;
        if (diff == 0) {
            diff = _minor - other._minor;
            if (diff == 0) {
                diff = _patchLevel - other._patchLevel;
                if (diff == 0) {
                    if (_snapshotInfo == null) {
                        return (other._snapshotInfo == null) ? 0 : 1;
                    }
                    if (other._snapshotInfo == null) {
                        return -1;
                    }
                    return _snapshotInfo.compareTo(other._snapshotInfo);
                }
            }
        }
        return diff;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Maintains the existing comparison of major, minor, and patch versions
2. If all those are equal, then compares the snapshotInfo (pre-release identifiers)
3. Follows semver rules where:
   - A version without snapshotInfo is considered greater than one with snapshotInfo (1.0.0 > 1.0.0-alpha)
   - If both have snapshotInfo, they are compared alphabetically (alpha < beta)
4. Matches the suggested behavior of sorting alphabetically

The fix ensures proper version ordering according to semver specifications while maintaining backward compatibility since the original behavior is preserved for versions without snapshotInfo.
