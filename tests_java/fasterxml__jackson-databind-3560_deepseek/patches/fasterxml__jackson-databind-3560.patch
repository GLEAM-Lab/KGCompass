Based on the issue, the problem is that `@JsonAnySetter` annotated Map fields need to be automatically instantiated when null, using standard Map implementations like HashMap or LinkedHashMap. The issue mentions `JDKValueInstantiators` as the class that handles this functionality.

Looking at the provided code segments, we don't see the actual implementation that handles `@JsonAnySetter` processing. However, we can see the `JDKValueInstantiators` class is referenced, though its full implementation isn't shown.

The fix would need to:
1. Check if the field is a Map type and null
2. Use `JDKValueInstantiators` to create an appropriate Map instance
3. Throw an exception if no suitable Map implementation can be found

Since we don't see the actual deserializer code that handles `@JsonAnySetter` in the provided segments, I can't provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE edit. The fix would need to be implemented in the class that processes `@JsonAnySetter` annotations during deserialization, likely in `BeanDeserializer` or similar.

The key parts would be:
1. When processing an `@JsonAnySetter` field, check if it's null
2. If it's a Map type, try to instantiate using `JDKValueInstantiators.findStdValueInstantiator()`
3. If instantiation fails, throw a clear exception

Would you be able to provide the code for the class that handles `@JsonAnySetter` processing? That would allow me to provide the exact edit needed. The fix would involve modifying that class to properly handle null Map fields by attempting instantiation before failing.

The general approach would be something like:

```java
if (mapField == null) {
    ValueInstantiator vi = JDKValueInstantiators.findStdValueInstantiator(config, mapField.getType());
    if (vi != null) {
        mapField = vi.createUsingDefault(ctxt);
    } else {
        throw new JsonMappingException("Cannot instantiate Map type for @JsonAnySetter: "+mapField.getType());
    }
}
```

But without seeing the actual deserializer code, I can't provide the exact file and line numbers to modify.
