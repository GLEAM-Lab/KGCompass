Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when deserializing custom Throwable subclasses that don't have single-String constructors. The problem stems from the removal of "builder.addIgnorable("localizedMessage")" and "builder.addIgnorable("suppressed")" in BeanDeserializerFactory.java (lines 452 and 454) in commit f27df635.

The fix would be to add back these ignorable properties for Throwable deserialization. Here's the edit:

```java
### playground/fasterxml__jackson-databind/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/BeanDeserializerFactory.java
- start_line : 450
- end_line : 454
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            // 27-May-2022, tatu: [databind#3497] Need to allow "message" as ignorable
            //   for Throwable subtypes
            builder.addIgnorable("message");

            // 27-May-2022, tatu: [databind#3497] Need to allow "message" as ignorable
            //   for Throwable subtypes
            builder.addIgnorable("message");
            builder.addIgnorable("localizedMessage");
            builder.addIgnorable("suppressed");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Keeps the existing line for "message" property
2. Adds back the "localizedMessage" and "suppressed" properties as ignorable
3. Maintains proper indentation
4. Preserves the existing comment

The fix allows deserialization of custom Throwable subclasses without requiring FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES to be disabled, while still properly handling the standard Throwable properties that may be present in the JSON but shouldn't cause failures if they can't be mapped.
