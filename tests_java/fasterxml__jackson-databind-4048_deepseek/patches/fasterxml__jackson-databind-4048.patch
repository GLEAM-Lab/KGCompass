Based on the issue description, there are two main problems:

1. `@JsonIgnore` no longer works for transient backing fields in Jackson 2.15+ unless `PROPAGATE_TRANSIENT_MARKER` is explicitly enabled
2. Mix-ins do not work for `Enum`s due to NPE issues

Looking at the issue details, the first problem appears to be related to a change in default behavior where `PROPAGATE_TRANSIENT_MARKER` needs to be enabled for `@JsonIgnore` to work properly with transient fields. The issue mentions that setting `mapper.configure(MapperFeature.PROPAGATE_TRANSIENT_MARKER, true)` fixes it.

Since this is a behavioral change that affects serialization security, we should modify the default configuration to enable `PROPAGATE_TRANSIENT_MARKER` by default in the `ObjectMapper` initialization.

Here's the proposed fix:

```java
### playground/fasterxml__jackson-databind/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.java
- start_line : 575
- end_line : 577
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    public ObjectMapper() {
        this(null, null, null);
    }
=======
    public ObjectMapper() {
        this(null, null, null);
        enable(MapperFeature.PROPAGATE_TRANSIENT_MARKER);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that `PROPAGATE_TRANSIENT_MARKER` is enabled by default for all new `ObjectMapper` instances, maintaining backward compatibility with the behavior in Jackson 2.14 and earlier where `@JsonIgnore` worked properly with transient fields.

For the second issue regarding Enum mix-ins, this appears to be a more complex architectural issue that requires changes to how annotations are processed for Enum values. The discussion indicates this would require interface changes and would need to be addressed in a future major version (2.12+). Since we don't have access to the relevant annotation processing code in the provided files, we cannot provide a fix for that part of the issue.

The change above focuses on the immediate security concern where sensitive data marked with `@JsonIgnore` and `transient` could be exposed unintentionally in Jackson 2.15+.
