Based on the issue, the bug occurs in `JsonPointer.append(JsonPointer.tail())` where the tail pointer's `_asString` still contains the original segments. The issue is that `tail()` returns `_nextSegment` but doesn't adjust the `_asString` to only include the tail segments.

The fix should modify the `append()` method to use the tail's string representation starting from its offset (`_asStringOffset`), not the full string. Here's the edit:

    public JsonPointer append(JsonPointer tail) {
        if (this == EMPTY) {
            return tail;
        }
        if (tail == EMPTY) {
            return this;
        }
        // 21-Mar-2017, tatu: Not superbly efficient; could probably improve by not concatenating,
        //    re-decoding -- by stitching together segments -- but for now should be fine.

        String currentJsonPointer = _asString;
        if (currentJsonPointer.endsWith("/")) {
            //removes final slash
            currentJsonPointer = currentJsonPointer.substring(0, currentJsonPointer.length()-1);
        }
        return compile(currentJsonPointer + tail._asString);
    }

    public JsonPointer append(JsonPointer tail) {
        if (this == EMPTY) {
            return tail;
        }
        if (tail == EMPTY) {
            return this;

            //removes final slash
            currentJsonPointer = currentJsonPointer.substring(0, currentJsonPointer.length()-1);
        }
        String tailStr = tail._asString;
        if (tail._asStringOffset > 0) {
            tailStr = tailStr.substring(tail._asStringOffset);
        }
        return compile(currentJsonPointer + tailStr);
    }

```

This change ensures that when appending a tail pointer, we only include the segments that come after the tail's offset. This matches the expected behavior where `append(tail())` should only include the segments from the tail onward, not the original pointer's segments.

The fix checks if the tail has an offset (`_asStringOffset > 0`) and if so, uses the substring starting from that offset. This way, when we append a tail pointer, we only get the segments that were actually in the tail portion.
