Based on the issue, we need to add a `pooledCount()` method to the `RecyclerPool` class to provide an estimate of recyclable entries. Since no actual code was provided, I'll make an educated guess about the class structure and propose adding this method.

Here's the proposed edit:

```java
### com/example/pool/RecyclerPool.java
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /**
     * Returns a recycled instance if available, or creates a new one
     */
    public T get() {
=======
    /**
     * Returns an estimate of the number of recyclable entries currently in the pool.
     * Note that this is just an approximation that may change immediately after being called.
     * 
     * @return approximate count of pooled recyclable entries
     */
    public int pooledCount() {
        return pool.size();
    }

    /**
     * Returns a recycled instance if available, or creates a new one
     */
    public T get() {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit:
1. Adds the new `pooledCount()` method before the existing `get()` method
2. Includes proper JavaDoc documentation
3. Assumes the pool is backed by a collection named `pool` (common convention)
4. Returns the size of this collection as the estimate

If the actual implementation uses a different field name for the pool storage (like `recycledObjects` or `entries`), the method body would need to be adjusted accordingly. The exact position in the file would also need to be adjusted based on where it makes most sense in the actual class structure.

Would you like me to adjust this proposal based on any additional context about the actual `RecyclerPool` implementation?
