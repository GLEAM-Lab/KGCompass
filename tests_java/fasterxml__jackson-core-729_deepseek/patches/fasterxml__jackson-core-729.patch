Based on the issue, the problem is that `TokenFilter` currently doesn't provide a way to preserve empty arrays and objects when filtering. The issue suggests adding two new methods to `TokenFilter` to allow control over this behavior.

Here are the necessary edits to implement this feature:

```java
### playground/fasterxml__jackson-core/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/filter/TokenFilter.java
- start_line : 58
- end_line : 58
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    protected TokenFilter() { }

    protected TokenFilter() { }

    /**
     * Method called to determine whether an empty array should be included in output.
     * 
     * @param contentsFiltered Whether any of the array contents were filtered out
     * @return True if empty array should be included; false if it should be excluded
     */
    public boolean includeEmptyArray(boolean contentsFiltered) {
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * Method called to determine whether an empty object should be included in output.
     * 
     * @param contentsFiltered Whether any of the object properties were filtered out
     * @return True if empty object should be included; false if it should be excluded
     */
    public boolean includeEmptyObject(boolean contentsFiltered) {
        return false;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit:
1. Keeps the existing constructor
2. Adds two new methods with proper JavaDoc documentation
3. Defaults both methods to return `false` to maintain backward compatibility (empty arrays/objects will be excluded by default)
4. Follows the suggested API from the issue

The methods allow implementers to override the behavior and choose whether to include empty arrays/objects based on whether their contents were filtered or if they were originally empty.

The `contentsFiltered` parameter helps distinguish between arrays/objects that were:
- Originally empty (contentsFiltered=false)
- Became empty due to filtering (contentsFiltered=true)

This matches exactly what was requested in the issue and provides the flexibility needed while maintaining backward compatibility.
