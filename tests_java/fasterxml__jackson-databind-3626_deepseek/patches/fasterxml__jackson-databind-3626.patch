Based on the issue, we need to add a `copyWith(JsonFactory)` method to `ObjectMapper` that allows creating a new `ObjectMapper` instance with the same configuration but a different `JsonFactory`. 

The current code shows there's a `copy()` method but no `copyWith()`. We should add this new method that creates a copy with a new `JsonFactory` while preserving all other configurations.

Here's the edit to add the new method:

```java
### playground/fasterxml__jackson-databind/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.java
- start_line : 713
- end_line : 716
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    public ObjectMapper copy() {
        _checkInvalidCopy(ObjectMapper.class);
        return new ObjectMapper(this);
    }
=======
    public ObjectMapper copy() {
        _checkInvalidCopy(ObjectMapper.class);
        return new ObjectMapper(this);
    }

    public ObjectMapper copyWith(JsonFactory jf) {
        _checkInvalidCopy(ObjectMapper.class);
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(this);
        mapper._jsonFactory = jf;
        return mapper;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit:
1. Keeps the existing `copy()` method unchanged
2. Adds new `copyWith(JsonFactory)` method right after it
3. The new method:
   - Performs the same validity check as `copy()`
   - Creates a new `ObjectMapper` copy using the existing copy constructor
   - Replaces the JsonFactory with the provided one
   - Returns the new mapper

The implementation preserves all existing configurations (serialization/deserialization settings, factories, etc.) while only changing the JsonFactory as requested in the issue.

The method placement right after `copy()` makes logical sense since they are related functionality. The indentation matches the existing code style (4 spaces for method bodies).
