Based on the issue, the problem is that when `JsonFactory.setStreamReadConstraints()` is called, it doesn't update the symbol table (`_rootCharSymbols`) with the new constraints. The symbol table is created once during initialization and never updated when constraints change.

The fix needs to update the symbol table when new constraints are set. Here are the necessary edits:

```java
### playground/fasterxml__jackson-core/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonFactory.java
- start_line : 872
- end_line : 875
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    public JsonFactory setStreamReadConstraints(StreamReadConstraints src) {
        _streamReadConstraints = Objects.requireNonNull(src);
        return this;
    }
=======
    public JsonFactory setStreamReadConstraints(StreamReadConstraints src) {
        _streamReadConstraints = Objects.requireNonNull(src);
        if (_rootCharSymbols != null) {
            _rootCharSymbols = CharsToNameCanonicalizer.createRoot(this);
        }
        return this;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that whenever stream read constraints are updated via `setStreamReadConstraints()`, the symbol table is recreated with the new constraints. The recreation is done by calling `createRoot()` again, which will pick up the new constraints from the factory.

The fix maintains backward compatibility while ensuring the constraints are properly applied to the symbol table. The null check for `_rootCharSymbols` is just defensive programming in case the method is called before initialization (though that shouldn't happen in normal usage).

This matches the behavior seen when using the builder approach, where the symbol table is created with the correct constraints during construction. Now both approaches will work consistently.
