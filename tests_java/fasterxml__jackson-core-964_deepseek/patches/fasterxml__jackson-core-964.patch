Based on the issue, the problem is that `StreamReadConstraints` cannot be directly set on `JsonFactory` - it can only be set through the Builder pattern. The issue requests adding a way to modify `StreamReadConstraints` directly on `JsonFactory` instances.

Looking at the code, we can see that `_streamReadConstraints` is a private field in `JsonFactory` that's only set during construction. We need to add a setter method to allow modifying it after construction.

Here's the edit to fix this:

```java
### playground/fasterxml__jackson-core/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonFactory.java
- start_line : 777
- end_line : 779
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    public StreamReadConstraints streamReadConstraints() {
        return _streamReadConstraints;
    }
=======
    public StreamReadConstraints streamReadConstraints() {
        return _streamReadConstraints;
    }

    public JsonFactory setStreamReadConstraints(StreamReadConstraints src) {
        _streamReadConstraints = src == null ? StreamReadConstraints.defaults() : src;
        return this;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Keeps the existing getter method `streamReadConstraints()`
2. Adds a new setter method `setStreamReadConstraints()` that:
   - Takes a `StreamReadConstraints` parameter
   - Handles null by falling back to defaults
   - Returns the factory instance for method chaining
   - Maintains the same pattern as other configuration methods in the class

The setter follows the same pattern as other configuration methods in `JsonFactory` (like `configure()`, `enable()`, etc) by returning the factory instance to allow method chaining.

This provides the direct mutable configuration capability requested in the issue while maintaining consistency with the existing API style.
