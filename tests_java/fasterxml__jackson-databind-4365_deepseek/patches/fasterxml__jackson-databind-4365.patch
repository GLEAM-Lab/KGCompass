Based on the issue description, the bug relates to how `AnnotationIntrospectorPair` should merge property name and namespace values from multiple annotations when the primary introspector returns empty/null values. However, the provided code segments don't actually include the `AnnotationIntrospectorPair` class implementation where this merging logic should be handled.

The issue specifically mentions that when there are multiple naming annotations (like `@JsonProperty` and `@JacksonXmlProperty`), the secondary introspector's values should be used if the primary returns empty/null for:
1. Local name
2. Namespace

Since we don't have the `AnnotationIntrospectorPair` class in the provided code segments, I can't provide the exact fix. The fix would need to be implemented in that class's methods that handle property name and namespace resolution, likely in methods like:
- `findNameForSerialization()`
- `findNameForDeserialization()`
- Other property name related methods

The fix would involve modifying these methods to:
1. First try getting the value from primary introspector
2. If primary returns null/empty, then try secondary introspector
3. Combine results appropriately

Could you please provide the code for the `AnnotationIntrospectorPair` class? That's where the actual bug fix needs to be implemented. The current provided code segments only show the base `AnnotationIntrospector` class which doesn't contain the pairing logic that needs to be fixed.

Without seeing the `AnnotationIntrospectorPair` implementation, I can't generate the correct *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix this issue. The fix would need to be in that class's property name resolution methods.
