Based on the issue discussion, the bug occurs when deserializing an empty string to Locale with `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` enabled. The issue suggests that the coercion configuration should be modified to handle Locale specially, returning `CoercionAction.TryConvert` instead of `CoercionAction.AsNull` for empty strings.

Looking at the code segments provided, we need to modify the coercion config handling in `ObjectMapper.java` to set the proper coercion action for Locale. The fix involves configuring the coercion settings for Locale to try conversion rather than treating empty string as null.

Here's the edit:

```java

    public ObjectMapper configure(DeserializationFeature f, boolean state) {
        _deserializationConfig = state ?
                _deserializationConfig.with(f) : _deserializationConfig.without(f);
        return this;
    }
=======
    public ObjectMapper configure(DeserializationFeature f, boolean state) {
        _deserializationConfig = state ?
                _deserializationConfig.with(f) : _deserializationConfig.without(f);
        if (f == DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT && state) {
            coercionConfigFor(Locale.class)
                .setCoercion(CoercionInputShape.EmptyString, CoercionAction.TryConvert);
        }
        return this;
    }

```

This change ensures that when `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` is enabled, Locale specifically will still attempt to convert empty strings (to `Locale.ROOT`) rather than treating them as null. This matches the expected behavior described in the issue while maintaining backward compatibility for other types.

The fix is similar to what @pkraeutli suggested in their workaround, but makes it automatic when configuring the feature rather than requiring manual configuration. This provides a more intuitive default behavior for Locale deserialization while still allowing the general `ACCEPT_EMPTY_STRING_AS_NULL_OBJECT` feature to work as expected for other types.
