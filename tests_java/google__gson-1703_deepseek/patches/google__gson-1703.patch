Based on the issue, the bug occurs when `Gson.toJson()` is called with an `Appendable` that's not a `Writer`. The problem is in the `AppendableWriter` class in `Streams.java` where the `CharSequence` implementation doesn't properly implement `toString()` as required by the `CharSequence` contract.

The fix needs to modify the `AppendableWriter.CurrentWrite` class to properly implement `toString()`. Here's the edit:

```java
### playground/google__gson/gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/Streams.java
- start_line : 87
- end_line : 89
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    AppendableWriter(Appendable appendable) {
      this.appendable = appendable;
    }
=======
    AppendableWriter(Appendable appendable) {
      this.appendable = appendable;
    }

    private class CurrentWrite implements CharSequence {
      char[] chars;
      int length;

      @Override public int length() {
        return length;
      }

      @Override public char charAt(int i) {
        return chars[i];
      }

      @Override public CharSequence subSequence(int start, int end) {
        return new String(chars, start, end - start);
      }

      @Override public String toString() {
        return new String(chars, 0, length);
      }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adds the proper `CurrentWrite` class implementation inside `AppendableWriter` that fully implements the `CharSequence` contract, including a correct `toString()` method that returns a string containing all characters in the sequence.

The fix ensures that when an `Appendable` implementation calls `toString()` on the `CharSequence` it receives (as shown in the example's `MyAppendable.append(CharSequence)` method), it will get the expected string representation of the JSON content rather than an incomplete or incorrect string.

The implementation matches the `CharSequence` contract by:
1. Storing characters in a char array
2. Providing correct implementations for all required methods
3. Having `toString()` return a string with all characters in order
4. Maintaining proper length handling

This should resolve the issue where `toString()` was not returning the complete character sequence as required.
